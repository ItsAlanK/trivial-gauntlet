# Trivial Gauntlet #
Tackle a gauntlet of trivia questions and see how far you can get with limited strikes in this multiple choice quiz. This game uses the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/) API to generate a gauntlet of questions to challenge the users' knowledge on various subjects. 

The game is set to an ancient Central American empire gauntlet style background inspired by more physical gauntlet challenges from TV such as Legends of the Hidden Temple and The Crystal Maze. There is also humour in treating the gauntlet as something serious and arduous while having the word trivial in the title.
